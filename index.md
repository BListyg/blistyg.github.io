title: About me / this website.
---

Iâ€™m an incoming PhD student studying Industrial-Organizational (I/O) Psychology at the University of Georgia advised by Nathan Carter. My substantive interests primarily revolve around vocational interests, occupational choice, and understanding how individual differences, such as personality, predict and/or explain labor market behavior. Methodologically, I am interested in item response theory, applied graph theory, mixed effects models, and missing data.

My current CV can be found [here.](CV WEBSITE HERE)
