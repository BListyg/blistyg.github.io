#### About me.

My name is Ben Listyg. Iâ€™m an incoming PhD student studying Industrial-Organizational (I-O) Psychology at the University of Georgia advised by Dr. Nathan Carter. My substantive research interests primarily revolve around vocational interests, occupational choice, and understanding how individual differences, such as personality, predict and/or explain labor market behavior. Methodologically, I am interested in item response theory, applied graph theory, mixed effects models, and missing data. 

I am passionate about open-source software, open social science, and statistical programming. I hope to use this website as a platform for discussing and showcasing my work in these areas.
