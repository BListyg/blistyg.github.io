title: About me / this website.
---

My name is Ben Listyg. I'm a Data Scientist with [Wyzant](www.wyzant.com) based out of Chicago, IL. I work at the intersection of graph theory, text mining, and causal inference to improve the learning and teaching experiences for students and tutors who use our platform. A 2019 goal I set for myself is to improve my technincal writing and share some of my work in a public setting. My _hope_ is that this website will help me accomplish that. You can follow me on twitter: [@benlistyg](www.twitter.com/blistyg)
