title: About me / this website.
---

My name is Ben Listyg. I'm a Data Scientist with [Wyzant](https://www.wyzant.com) based out of Chicago, IL. I work at the intersection of applied graph theory, text mining, and causal inference to improve the learning and teaching experiences for the students and tutors who use our platform. A 2019 goal I set for myself is to improve my technincal writing as well as share some of my work in a public setting. My _hope_ is that this website will help me accomplish that. 

You can follow me on twitter [@benlistyg](https://www.twitter.com/benlistyg).

You can read my poorly written code on my [Github](https://www.github.com/blistyg).
